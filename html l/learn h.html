                        <b>HTML</b> is actually shorthand for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the language of Web
                        pages that tells a browser how to display certain elements, such as text and images
                        through the use of codes and symbols.
                        HTML is the standard when it comes to creating Web pages. The World Wide Web
                        Consortium, or W3C recommends it. Being such, most browsers implement HTML to
                        help display Web pages more or less uniformly.<br><br><br>

                        HTML is the brainchild of Tim BernersLee.
                        In 1990, BernersLee
                        needed something
                        that would help scientists coming from different colleges and universities access
                        documents and research from other scientists. That problem led to BernersLee
                        inventing the World Wide Web, the hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP, and HTML.

                        This is another good news: when you are learning HTML, you do not need much.
                        You can start with using Notepad, a text editor that is included in your Windows
                        installation. If you are not using Windows, or if you prefer other text editors, there is a
                        lot of free software that you can download from the Internet.
                        Or you could get one of those HTML or WYSIWYG editors. WYSIWYG stands for
                        "what you see is what you get." Think of it as a layout tool that allows you to easily
                        create an HTML page and format it without bothering too much about tags and
                        elements. <br>
                        So we do recommend hardcoding
                        if you are still learning. Hardcoding
                        means to write
                        HTML using a text editor. There are two things that you need to know to get started
                        with HTML:
                        <br><br>  
                        1. <i>The basic tags and elements</i> <br>
                        2. <i>The structure of an HTML page.</i> <br> 
                    </p>
                </div> 
               </div>
               
               <h1>
                1. The basic tags and elements
               </h1>
               <div class="features-desc">
                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>
                        HTML is a markup language. As such, you will need to know the various tags and
                        elements that it uses. <br><br><br>
                        <img src="im2.png" alt=""> <br> <br> <br>
                        Tags usually come in pairs. An opening tag will signify that the browser should treat the
                        succeeding text using that tag's properties and a closing tag would end it. <br>
                        For example, the opening < strong > tag and its corresponding closing < /strong > tag will
                       render all the text in between in bold. i.e., <br>
                       “My name is < strong >Clark Kent< /strong >” will be displayed as: <br>
                      <strong>My name is Clark Kent.</strong> <br>
                      And then there are what we call the "empty elements" or those that work without a
                      closing or opening tag. Empty elements are often described as selfclosing
                      tags. <br><br>
                      <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 32px;">
                        There are quite a few empty elements such as: <br><br>

                        <li>area</li>
                        <li>base</li>
                        <li>basefont</li>
                        <li>br</li>
                        <li>col</li>
                        <li>frame</li>
                        <li>hr</li>
                        <li>img</li>
                        <li>input</li>
                        <li>isindex</li>
                        <li>link</li>
                        <li>meta</li>
                        <li>param</li>

                      </ul>
                      <br><br>
                      All of these can stand alone. For example, line breaks in HTML documents are often
                      denoted by < br />
                    </p>
                </div>
               </div>
               <h1>
                2. Structure of an HTML page:
               </h1>
               <div class="features-desc">
                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>
                        HTML is very simple and it is logical. A browser would start reading an HTML page
                        from the top going down, from left going right. <br>
                        It does follow a basic structure. First, you have to declare that the document is an
                        HTML document. You can do this by using the < html > tag. <br>
                        Then there are the two other sections called the < head > and < body > of your
                        document. <br>
                        The < head > is where you put in all the information you want to include about your
                        document. <br>
                        The < body > is basically the content of your HTML document.
                        Put in another way, the < body > section is what people see when they view your HTML
                        document. <br><br><br>
                        <img src="im.png" alt=""><br><br>
                        Remember how you need to close a tag in HTML? You would also need to close
                        <html>, <head> and <body>, so that the basic HTML document would look like this: <br><br>
                            < html > <br><br>
                                < head > <br><br>
                                          < /head > <br><br>
                                       < body > <br><br>
                                < /body > <br><br>
                                < /html > <br><br>
                                Now you have the foundations of creating your first HTML page!

                    <p>When learning about HTML, you will come across different resources that may use
                        HTML elements and tags interchangeably. Chances are, that's because they wanted to
                        simplify everything and make it easier for you to understand. However, there is a
                        difference when you refer to HTML elements and HTML tags. 
                    </p>
                </div>
               </div>
               <h1>
                What's the difference?
               </h1>
               <div class="features-desc">
                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>Technically, HTML documents contain only tags. When they are accessed on a
                        browser, HTML documents are then parsed so that these could be displayed using the
                        Document Object Model (DOM). The tags are there in the HTML document, but HTML
                        elements only appear after the document has been parsed. <br>
                        But let's not get into the technical stuff and instead simplify our lives by using what is
                        commonly understood. To put it simply, HTML tags are the markup language that you
                        use in HTML. These are generally the start or opening tag and the closing or ending
                        tag. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < >. <br>
                        HTML elements, on the other hand, include the content. < br >
                        So, given this: < p >This is the difference between HTML elements and tags. < /p >. The
                        tags here are < p > and < /p > , while the whole thing is called an HTML element. 
                    </p>
                </div>
               </div>

                    <p>
                        Now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at HTML elements. <br>
                        An HTML element has the following syntax: <br>
                        <b>1.</b> An HTML element begins with an opening or start tag, i.e.,  < p >. <br>
                        <b>2.</b> An HTML element ends with a closing or end tag, i.e. < /p >. <br>
                        <b>3.</b> The property of an HTML content is enclosed within the start and end tags, i.e., <br>
                         This is the element content. < /p >. <br>
                         <b>4.</b> It may also contain an attribute. <br>   
                    </p>
                </div>
               </div>

               <h1>
                1. Empty Elements:

               <div class="features-desc">
                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>Some HTML elements do have content and are simply called empty elements. These
                       elements are ended or closed with the opening tag, i.e, < br />.
                    </p>

                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>Then there is also what is called the "nestled elements." Nestled elements are HTML
                        elements that are found within other HTML elements. For example, this is a nestled
                        element: <br>
                        < p > I do not know < strong >  what it was< /strong >.< /p > <br>
                        Lastly, an HTML element may contain attributes, which we will discuss later on.

                    <p>
                        HTML elements serve a variety of purposes: <br>
                        1. HTML elements can describe the purpose of the text, as well as give it structure. A
                        good example of this type of HTML elements is < h1 >, < h2 > and other HTML headers.
                        For instance,< h1 >Introduction< /h1 > communicates that "Introduction" is a first level
                        heading. Take note that structural HTML elements only provide structure and do not
                        have specific standards for display. A browser, however, can have default display for
                        this type of elements, hence you often see header tags being bigger than normal text
                        on your browser. <br> 
                        2. HTML elements can dictate how certain content would appear. For instance, using
                         < b > would render the text in boldface, while using < i > will display the text in italics. <br>
                         3. HTML elements that link your HTML document to another documents. For instance,
                        you can use < a > to link your document to another document. <br>   
                    </p>
                </div>
               </div>

               <h1>
                Tips:
               </h1>
               <div class="features-desc">
                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>
                        1. Always put in the closing tag. <br>
                        There are HTML elements that are not empty elements but may be written without a
                        closing tag. Because browsers are able to recognize them, they present no problem.
                        For example, the < p > element, which starts a paragraph, is often not closed.
                        < p >This is what we are talking about. <br>
                        However, it is still best practice to close HTML elements.
                        Most Web browsers will consider the closing tag for < p > optional and the paragraph
                        will display properly. Yet, this would not be the case for all Web browsers. To be sure,
                        always put the closing tag at the end. <br>
                        How is this case different from empty elements? An empty element is when no closing
                        tags are required. Additionally, no closing tags exist or are allowed in empty elements.
                        For example, <br> does not have a corresponding closing tag: </ br> does not exist in
                        HTML. <br>
                        Whereas, technically, you would need to close the HTML element above by using < /p >. <br>
                        2. Use lowercase when writing elements. <br>
                        HTML tags are not case sensitive. This means that you can write < p >, < P > or even
                        </ P> or </ p>.   <br>
                        However, standards and recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium or
W3C recommend using lowercase for HTML elements in HTML4 and requires it in
XHTML. So you might as well start training yourself in writing HTML elements in
lowercase.

                Attributes:
               </h1>
               <div class="features-desc">
                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>Another term you would need to know when it comes to HTML elements are attributes.
                        Attributes modify the tags where they appear. Attributes are namevalue
                        pairs, which
                        are separated by the equal sign. <br>
                        The HTML element < a href="nextofkin.html">Next of kin< /a> contains the attribute
                        href="nextofkin.html". Attributes usually use the following syntax: <br>
                        < tag attribute="value of attribute">content< /tag> <br>
                        A lot of people confuse the alt attribute as a tag. It is not. The alt attribute modifies the
                        < img>, < area>, < input> and < applet > tags, which makes it an attribute. <br>
                        <br>Some of the most commonly used attributes, aside from href and alt include: <br>
                     <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 32px; line-height: 26px;">
                        <li>align</li>
                        <li>bgcolor</li>
                        <li>src</li>
                        <li>height</li>
                        <li>width</li>
                        <li>value</li>
                        <li>href</li>
                        <li>hspace</li>
                        <li>id</li>
                        <li>class</li>
                        <li>style</li>
                        <li>title</li>
                        <li>dir</li>
                        <li>lang</li>
                     </ul> 
                     <br> These are the basics you need to know about tags, attributes and elements.

                    <p>One of the things that you should realize when working with HTML is that it is not just a
                        markup language that you need to use in order to create a Web page. HTML is highly
                        readable and understandable, even though you are just looking at its code. For the
                        most part, you would see how everything is structured just by looking at its code.
                        So looking at the source code, you would be able to look at an HTML document and
                        understand how a page would look like. <br>
                        With that in mind, you should be able to work pretty well with titles, paragraphs and
                        headings. <br><br><br>

                <div class="features-text">
                    <p>As with any book, article or any printed works, your HTML document should have a
                        title. <br>
                        The title is required for all HTML documents and it comes with other benefits: <br>
                        <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 32px; line-height: 26px;">
                            <li>It will identify what your document is all about.</li>
                            <li>Titles also show up on the browser window or tab, making it easy for people to
                                identify which tab to click on to access your Web page if they have a lot of tabs
                                open at the same time.</li>
                            <li>It is one of the things that search engines look at in order to determine the
                                content of your page. Search engine result pages (SERPs) will display the title
                                of your document as the result’s main heading.</li>
