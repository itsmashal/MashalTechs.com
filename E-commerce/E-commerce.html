                    E-commerce is the process of buying and selling of various products and services 
                    by businesses through the Internet. It deals various kind of business concern, 
                    from retail site of the consumer, which includes auction. The main focus is to
                     concentrate on business substitutes involving goods and services between various corporations.
                    E-commerce is the purpose of Internet and the web to Conduct business but when we
                     concentrate on commercial deals among organizations and individuals demanding 
                     selective information systems under the guarantee of the firm it accepts the form
                      of e-business. Nowadays, the word ‘e’ is hitting momentum.
                    Ecommerce (e-commerce) or electronic commerce, a subset of ebusiness, is the purchasing,
                     selling, and exchanging of goods and services over computer networks (such as the Internet)
                      through which transactions or terms of sale are performed electronically. Contrary to popular 
                      belief, ecommerce is not just on the Web. In fact, ecommerce was alive and well in business 
                      to business transactions before the
                     Web back in the 70s via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) through VANs (Value-Added Networks).

                    <br><br><b style="color: #009688;padding-bottom: 15px;">Ecommerce can be broken into four main categories: B2B, B2C, C2B, and C2C.</b> <br>

   <b style="color: #009688; text-decoration: underline;"> 1 ) B2B(Business-to-Business)</b> <br>  Companies doing business with each other such as manufacturers selling to distributors and wholesalers selling to retailers. Pricing is based on quantity of order and is often negotiable. <br> 
   <b style="color: #009688; text-decoration: underline;"> 2 ) B2C(Business-to-Consumer)</b> <br> Businesses selling to the general public typically through catalogs utilizing shopping cart software. By dollar volume, B2B takes the prize, however B2C is really what the average Joe has in mind with regards to ecommerce as a whole. Having a hard time finding a book? Need to purchase a custom, high-end computer system? How about a first class, all-inclusive trip to a tropical island? With the advent ecommerce, all three things can be purchased literally in minutes without human interaction. Oh how far we've come!
  <br> <b style="color: #009688; text-decoration: underline;"> 3 )C2B(Consumer-to-Business) </b> <br> A consumer posts his project with a set budget online and within hours companies review the consumer's requirements and bid on the project. The consumer reviews the bids and selects the company that will complete the project. Elance empowers consumers around the world by providing the meeting ground and platform for such transactions.
  <br> <b style="color: #009688; text-decoration: underline;"> 4 ) C2C(Consumer-to-Consumer)</b> <br> There are many sites offering free classifieds, auctions, and forums where individuals can buy and sell thanks to online payment systems like PayPal where people can send and receive money online with ease. eBay's auction service is a great example of where person-to-person transactions take place everyday since 1995. <br>
<br> <br> Companies using internal networks to offer their employees products and services online--not necessarily online on the Web--are engaging in B2E (Business-to-Employee)ecommerce. G2G (Government-to-Government), G2E (Government-to-Employee), G2B (Government-to-Business), B2G (Business-to-Government), G2C (Government-to-Citizen), C2G (Citizen-to-Government) are other forms of ecommerce that involve transactions with the government--from procurement to filing taxes to business registrations to renewing licenses. There are other categories of ecommerce out there, but they tend to be superfluous.

           Difference Between E-business and E-Commerce
           </h1><br><br>
           <div class="features-desc">
            <div class="features-text">
                <p>
                  E -business and e-commerce are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, and sometimes they're used to 
                  differentiate one vendor's product from another. But the terms are different, and that difference matters to 
                  today's companies. In both cases, the e stands for "electronic networks" and describes the application of 
                  electronic network technology - including Internet and electronic data interchange (EDI) - to improve and
                   change business processes. E-commerce covers outward-facing processes that touch customers, suppliers and 
                   external partners, including sales, marketing, order taking, delivery, customer service, purchasing of 
                   raw materials and supplies for production and procurement of indirect operating-expense items, such as
                    office supplies. It involves new business models and the potential to gain new revenue or lose some 
                    existing revenue to new competitors. It's ambitious but relatively easy to implement because it involves 
                    only three types of integration: vertical integration of front-end Web site applications to existing 
                    transaction systems; cross-business integration of a company with Web sites of customers, suppliers or
                     intermediaries such as Web-based marketplaces; and integration of technology with modestly redesigned
                      processes for order handling, purchasing or customer service. E-business includes e-commerce but also
                       covers internal processes such as production, inventory management, product development, risk management,
                        finance, knowledge management and human resources. E-business strategy is more complex, more focused 
                        on internal processes, and aimed at cost savings and improvements in efficiency, productivity and 
                        cost savings. An e-business strategy is also more difficult to execute, with four directions of 
                        integration: vertically, between Web front- and back-end systems; laterally, between a company and 
                        its customers, business partners, suppliers or intermediaries; horizontally, among e-commerce, 
                        enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), knowledge management 
                        and supply-chain management systems; and downward through the enterprise, for integration of new
                         technologies with radically redesigned business processes. But e-business has a higher payoff
                          in the form of more efficient processes, lower costs and potentially greater profits. E-commerce 
                          and e-business both address these processes, as well as a technology infrastructure of databases, 
                          application servers, security tools, systems management and legacy systems. And both involve the 
                          creation of new value chains between a company and its customers and suppliers, as well as within the
                           company itself. All companies should have an e-commerce strategy. (Governments should have an e-public
                            service strategy.) Electronic networks in general and the Internet in particular are too 
                            important for firms to ignore if they want to interact with customers, suppliers or distribution partner
                            s. But some companies need to move beyond e-commerce and form e-business strategies - especially large 
                            companies that already have links to EDI networks or have completed major ERP implementations. 
                            These companies have already reaped some of the biggest benefits from e-commerce strategies. 
                            They're also likely to experience organizational pain as conflicts develop among their ERP, EDI,
                             supply-chain management and e-commerce strategies. And last, they have enough experience and knowledge
                              in electronic-network technologies - and in process redesign and integration - that they have a 
                              chance of being successful in an e-business strategy. Still, the coordination and organizational
                               obstacles to developing an e-business strategy are formidable. It involves major and potentially
                                disruptive organizational change. The risks of failure and the consequences from limited success
                                 are higher in an e-business strategy than in an e-commerce strategy. Being a leader in e-business
                                  can contribute to long-term success, but the stresses and strains of business transformation can
                                   cause near-term damage. A wise company may decide to consolidate its gains and complete the work
                                    involved in its existing and largely separate e-commerce, ERP, CRM or supply-chain initiatives
                                     before making the big leap to becoming an e-business
                                     E-commerce is the use of internet and the web to make business transactions. Millions of people 
                                     make purchases on the web, so what makes e-commerce so special.

                    B2C stands for Business to Consumer as the name suggests,
                     it is the model taking businesses and consumers interaction.
                      Online business sells to individuals. The basic concept of
                       this model is to sell the product online to the consumers.
                    B2c is the indirect trade between the company and consumers.
                     It provides direct selling through online. For example: <br>
                     if you want to sell goods and services to customer so 
                     that anybody can purchase any products directly from supplier’s website.
                    Directly interact with the customers is the main difference with
                     other business model. As B2B it manages directly relationship with consumers, B2C supply chains normally deal with business that are related to the customer.
